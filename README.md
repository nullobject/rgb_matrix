# RGB Matrix

My fork of the firmware for the [SparkFun RGB LED matrix](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=760).

This fork addresses a number of issues with the original firmware, including:

* Corrects the coordinate system: bytes are displayed left-right, top-bottom.
* Disables the control byte which sets the number of LED matrices.
